# Set up your app

Your app sets Herald up in one place: on Android, usually your dependency injection setup and the
Application class; on Flutter, `main()` and whatever shares objects in your app; on iOS, the app
delegate and whatever builds your objects. That place creates the vendors, builds one `Herald` from
them, starts it, and hands it to the rest of the app. No other code names a vendor or `Herald`
itself.

## Build Herald with your vendors

Herald sends every call to each vendor you register. A registered vendor is called a
**provider**. Keeping each provider in its own small function keeps this part short:

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "samples/CompositionRoot.kt:herald"
    ```

=== "Dart"

    ```dart
    --8<-- "docs_samples/lib/composition_root.dart:herald"
    ```

=== "Swift"

    ```swift
    --8<-- "Samples/Sources/Samples/CompositionRoot.swift:herald"
    ```

Each of those functions looks like the Firebase one from the
[Quick start](quick-start.md#4-add-firebase), and each [vendor page](../vendors/firebase.md) shows
its own. A provider has a name and the parts of Herald that the vendor supports: events, user
properties, sign-in, start-up and consent. Leave out what a vendor doesn't have. AppsFlyer keeps no
user properties, for example, so its provider has no `properties`.

- **Pick a name you'd recognise in a crash log.** It's the name Herald reports when that vendor
  fails.
- **On Android, `providers(...)` takes vendors that are already built,** which is handy when your
  DI collects them from several modules. `provider(...)` builds one in place from its parts. You
  can use both in the same `Herald { }` block. On Flutter, `Herald(providers: [...])` takes a list
  of `HeraldProvider`s, wherever they come from.

## Give it to your classes

Your classes never ask for `Herald` itself. Each one asks for the small interface it needs, and
you pass the same `Herald` for all of them:

| A class that… | asks for |
| --- | --- |
| tracks events | `EventTrackerService` |
| sets user properties | `PropertyTrackerService` |
| signs users in and out | `IdentifiableUserService` |
| starts or flushes analytics | `AnalyticsLifecycleService` |
| records the user's consent | `ConsentService` |

That keeps each class honest about what it does, and easy to test with a fake.

!!! warning "Bind only `Herald`, never a vendor's own tracker"
    Each vendor's tracker also implements `EventTrackerService`. If you bind one of those too, a
    class can end up with it and send events to that one vendor only. Nothing fails to compile and
    nothing crashes. The events are just missing everywhere else.

=== "Kotlin"

    === "Manual"

        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "samples/di/ManualSetup.kt:manual"
        ```

    === "Koin"

        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "samples/di/KoinSetup.kt:koin"
        ```

        Each vendor module adds its provider with `single<Herald.Provider>(named("firebase")) { … }`.
        Give each one a name like that: Koin keeps only one of two unnamed definitions of the same
        type, so `getAll` would find just one provider.

    === "Hilt"

        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "samples/di/HiltSetup.kt:hilt"
        ```

        Each vendor module adds its provider with `@Provides @IntoSet`.

=== "Dart"

    ```dart
    --8<-- "docs_samples/lib/di/manual_setup.dart:manual"
    ```

    With a package such as get_it or Riverpod, register the one `Herald` and hand it out as each of
    the interfaces above, the same way.

=== "Swift"

    ```swift
    --8<-- "Samples/Sources/Samples/DI/ManualSetup.swift:manual"
    ```

    With a container such as Factory or Swinject, register the one `Herald` and hand it out as
    each of the protocols above, the same way.

## Start it

Call `start()` once, when the app starts, and then apply the consent decision the user made last
time. Some vendors forget it between launches, and some of Herald's vendor modules keep a vendor
quiet at start-up on purpose, until consent is applied (see [Consent](../guides/consent.md)).

Do it where the vendors' own setup guides initialise their SDKs, on every start of your app:

=== "Kotlin"

    Do it in `Application.onCreate()`, in a scope that lives as long as the app. It runs on every
    start, including ones without a screen, like a push notification or a WorkManager job:

    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "samples/CompositionRoot.kt:start-from-application"
    ```

=== "Dart"

    Do it in `main()`, before `runApp`, and await each call: Herald doesn't order calls you don't
    await.

    ```dart
    --8<-- "docs_samples/lib/composition_root.dart:start-from-main"
    ```

=== "Swift"

    Do it in your app delegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`, after the
    vendors' own setup. Calls keep their order, so there's nothing to wait for:

    ```swift
    --8<-- "Samples/Sources/Samples/CompositionRoot.swift:start-from-main"
    ```

If a user is signed in, call `identify(...)` between the two calls. Some vendors forget the user
between launches, and AppsFlyer attaches the user id to the launch it sends when consent is
applied. See [Identity](../guides/identity.md#every-cold-start).

If your app uses use cases, these two calls fit in one, like `StartAnalyticsUseCase` in the
[Moove](https://github.com/MkhytarMkhoian/Moove) sample app.

On Android, an app with a single activity and no background work can do the same from that
activity's ViewModel instead. Moove does this: its main activity's ViewModel also handles deep
links, so nothing is tracked before the vendors have started.

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "samples/CompositionRoot.kt:start-from-entry"
    ```

## When a vendor fails

If a vendor's SDK throws, or on iOS reports a failure, Herald catches the error and still sends to
the other vendors, so analytics never crashes your app. The downside is that a vendor failing on
every call looks just like one that works. That's why the example above passes an
`errorReporter`: send the errors to the crash or logging tool you already use.

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    errorReporter { provider, operation, failure ->
        crashlytics.recordException(failure)
    }
    ```

=== "Dart"

    ```dart
    errorReporter: (failure) => FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(
      failure.error,
      failure.stackTrace,
      reason: '$failure', // e.g. "adjust failed on Track(checkout_started): ..."
    ),
    ```

=== "Swift"

    ```swift
    errorReporter: { failure in
        // e.g. "adjust failed on Track(checkout_started): ..."
        Crashlytics.crashlytics().record(error: failure.error, userInfo: ["call": "\(failure)"])
    }
    ```

- **The operation says what failed:** `Track(checkout_started)`, `SetProperty(plan)`, `Identify`,
  `Start`, and so on. It holds names only, never parameter values or the user id, so it's safe to
  send to another tool.
- **Errors arrive one at a time,** after every vendor has finished, so your reporter doesn't need
  to be thread-safe. On iOS each arrives as soon as its vendor reports it, on the thread that made
  the call.
- **If your reporter throws,** Herald catches that too. On Flutter, a reporter that returns a
  failed `Future` is caught as well, and Herald doesn't wait for it.
- **On Android, cancelling the caller isn't an error.** If the coroutine that called Herald is
  cancelled, the cancellation carries on as usual and nothing is reported.

## Threads and order

On Android and Flutter, vendors are called at the same time, so one slow vendor doesn't hold up
the others, and a call returns when every vendor has finished. Tracking from UI code is safe on
every platform.

=== "Kotlin"

    Herald never calls a vendor SDK on the main thread. It uses `Dispatchers.Default` unless you
    pass another dispatcher:

    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "samples/CompositionRoot.kt:dispatcher"
    ```

    - **Calls are suspend functions,** so two events from the same coroutine always reach a vendor
      in the order you tracked them.
    - **In tests,** pass a test dispatcher, such as `StandardTestDispatcher()`, so the calls run in
      a predictable order.

=== "Dart"

    There is no dispatcher: vendor plugins already do their work off the UI thread.

    - **A call starts at once and doesn't wait for earlier ones.** Two calls you don't await, such
      as `onPressed: () => analytics.track(event)`, can reach a vendor in either order. When order
      matters, await the first call.

=== "Swift"

    There is no queue: Herald calls each vendor on your thread, one after another, and vendor SDKs
    do their own work in the background.

    - **Calls keep their order.** When `track` returns, every vendor has the event, so the next
      call always reaches them after it.
    - **Calls from different threads at the same moment** can reach a vendor in either order, as
      on the other platforms.
